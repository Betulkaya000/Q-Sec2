# How to Initialize a Directory to GitHub (Public/Private)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub and log in
   - Click the '+' icon and select 'New repository'
   - Choose a name for your repository
   - Select 'Public' or 'Private' as desired
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

2. Initialize your local directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   git init
   ```

3. Add your files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit the files:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. Add the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

6. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Your local directory is now initialized and pushed to GitHub as either a public or private repository, depending on your selection in step 1.
